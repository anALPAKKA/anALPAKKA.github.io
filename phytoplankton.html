                            </header>
                            
                            <p>Phytoplankton may be tiny, but they run a huge part of the planet. Collectively, they contribute roughly 
							   half of Earth’s primary production [1]—meaning that about every second “bite” of new organic matter produced on 
								Earth is made by them. Because phytoplankton sit at the base of marine food webs, phytoplankton also help steer 
								the global cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and many other compounds that climate and ecosystems depend on.
							</p>

							<p>
								In the ocean’s sunlit surface layer (the euphotic zone), phytoplankton use photosynthesis to take up carbon and build biomass. 
								That biomass is then eaten by zooplankton, which in turn are eaten by larger organisms. But not all of this material stays near 
								the surface. Some of it sinks—either because phytoplankton clump together and fall like “marine snow,” or because zooplankton package 
								it into fast-sinking fecal pellets. The result is a net transfer of carbon and nutrients from the surface to deeper waters. 
								This conveyor belt of life and sinking particles is known as the biological pump [2]. It matters because it helps regulate how much CO₂ 
								the ocean can store away from the atmosphere.								
							</p>
								
								<!--Phytoplankton contribute about 50 percent to the global primary production on Earth [1] and are important 
                                for the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur and other compounds. 
                                In the eutrophic zone photosynthesis leads to uptake of carbon by phytoplankton, which is grazed on by zooplankton. 
                                Sinking of organic matter due to phytoplankton aggregation and sinking, as well as zooplankton excretion leads to a reduction 
                                of carbon and nutrient concentrations at the surface. This process is called the biological pump [2]. -->
 </p>
          <p>Despite the importance of phytoplankton for global biogeochemical cycles and cli mate, their composition and dynamics is still poorly understood. 
              There are only few observations, and many species have not been identified or do not survive in culture. 
              For example, recent research related to the TARA Oceans project showed a far larger diversity of eukaryotic phytoplankton than previously catalogued [3].

                            <p> At a single location—like the Santa Monica Bay station in Fig. 1—the relative contribution of different phytoplankton groups 
								can swing dramatically over time. These jagged ups and downs naturally invite a provocative question: are phytoplankton dynamics chaotic—or 
								are they simply responding to shifting conditions? On the other hand, fluctuations like those in Fig. 1 are not observed on large spatial scales, 
                                where external forcings like diffusion override the internal phytoplankton dynamics.

                                <h3>A Simple 1-D Model</h3>
                                
                            </header>
								
                                <p> 
								This project tackles that question with a conceptual 1-D model designed by Scheffer [5]: a three-species food web where autotrophic phytoplankton (A) grow, 
								herbivorous zooplankton (Z) graze them, and carnivorous zooplankton (C) snack on the grazers.  
								The model was designed specifically to explore whether strange attractors might lurk behind plankton dynamics. 
								The fun part is the experimental setup: first you let biology run the show (no vertical mixing), then you switch on vertical diffusion—a simple stand-in 
								for the ocean’s habit of blending neighbouring layers together—and watch whether the “internal drama” survives.
								</p> 	
									
								<p>
									The model lives in a 1D water column from 0 to 100 m, with daily time steps. Phytoplankton growth is strongest at the surface and decreases linearly 
									with depth—basically a simplified “less light, less growth” rule:
								</p>



								  <div class="equation" aria-label="Depth-dependent phytoplankton growth rate">
								    <p>
								      <em>r</em>(<em>z</em>) = <em>r</em><sub>max</sub>
								      &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;
								      (1 &minus; <em>z</em>/100)
								    </p>
								  </div>
								
								  <p>
								    So at <strong>0 m</strong>, growth is maximal; at <strong>100 m</strong>, it drops to zero.
								  </p>
								
								  <p>
								    Biologically, the equations include:
								  </p>
								
								  <ul>
								    <li>growth and self-limitation for phytoplankton (<strong>A</strong>),</li>
								    <li>grazing of <strong>A</strong> by herbivorous zooplankton (<strong>Z</strong>),</li>
								    <li>predation of <strong>Z</strong> by carnivorous zooplankton (<strong>C</strong>),</li>
								    <li>and mortality terms.</li>
								  </ul>
								
								  <p>
								    Grazing and predation follow saturating (Holling-type) functions so feeding doesn’t increase
								    forever with prey abundance.
								  </p>
								
								  <p>
								    Numerically, the system is integrated with SciPy’s <code>solve_ivp</code>. Then comes the twist:
								    <strong>vertical diffusion</strong> is added using a seasonally varying mixed layer depth (MLD),
								    which sets a depth- and time-dependent diffusion coefficient
								    <em>k</em><sub>z</sub>. In the report, diffusion is strongest near the surface and varies with an
								    annual MLD cycle (illustrated in Fig. 2).
								  </p>

									<!--On the modelling side, Lotka-Volterra models of competition and predation have been analysed for nearly 100 years and it 
                                    was found that chaotic behaviour is possible if at least 4 species are involved [4]. 
                                    The model of Scheffer [5] is an evolution of the Lotka-Volterra descriptions containing three species and more biology. 
                                    Here we will use it to analyse interactions between these species, both with and without a physical process (vertical diffusion), 
                                    to investigate the internal behaviour of the model and whether it is overridden by the physical process. -->
