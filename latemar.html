                            <p> Latemar is a carbonate platform with a  radius of around 3 km located in North Italy.
                                It was formed during Middle Triassic around westernmost area of Triassic Tethys under marine environment. The focus of this essay is on the top 470 m of the Latemar platform succession, which contains around 600 cycles,
                               group of 5 thinning-upward megacycles.</p>

                            <p> The Latemar controversy is over the mechanism of Latemar formation.
                              Intense debates exist among researchers on whether the strong cyclic character of Latemar was mainly autocyclic, 
                              meaning driven by external forcing, or allocyclic, driven by more local forcings.
                              Whilst Goldhammer and Hinnov[1] proposed that the 600-700 cycles of Latemar were formed through 9-12 million years ago (mya), 
                              Brack and Kent[2] argued that the formation time was much shorter. As the Middle Triassic is about 10 million years, 
                              it is doubted that the formation of Latemar could take more than the whole middle Triassic.</p>

                            <p> If we take Latemar setting to a sketch, we can see in the middle are Latemar and other carbonate platforms
                                (From bottom to top we have Contrin formation, lower platform facies, lower cyclic facies, 
                                tepee facies, upper cyclic facies. On the sides are slopes) So a more simplified sketch would look like this
                                Red line: continuously growing beds of carbonate platform (600-800 m thick platform interior succession)
                                Orange line: slope, dipping beds of rubble
                                In the middle is the carbonate platform, formed under the influence of sea surface fluctuations
                                basinal deposits is about 60-70 m. </p>

                               we have a series of carbonate platform and basinal beds.

                               <p>One of the methods to date Latemar succession is to connect the layers in Latemar to somewhere else where the age is better dated 
                               and use that as the age of latemar formation. For example, if we can find some layers in Latemar corresponding some layers in buchenstein beds, 
                               then the period for latemar formation would be just the same as the time taken to form the corresponding buchenstein beds
                               This brings us to the first method, biostratigraphy.</p>
                            
                            <p> With biostratigraphy, fossils of ammonites and Daonella were sampled. (This is a pic of ammonites.)
                                Dark ammonites: were found in basinal Buchenstein Beds, they were formed in pelagic environment. 
                                Brighter ammonites: found in Latemar, deposited in platform interior. 
                                But they are of the same type. so if same type of ammonites fossils can be found in both basinal bed and the Latemar, 
                                they are coeval Faunas L1–L4 are ammonoids and Daonella. 
                                At the beginning ammonites were only found in very low altitude in Latemer (show L1 in graph), 
                                so only lower age boundary was certain. For the upper age threshold they first used L3 and L4, 
                                found on the slopes near latemar, which were interpreted to be coeval to upper cyclic Latemar succession
                                Later (2003): ammonites were found also on top of Latemar (L5, see image to the left), 
                                which finally enabled defining the upper age boundary. 
                                These fossils were connected the same type of ammonites found in the Buchenstein beds of Bagolino and Seceda (next slide)</p>
                           <p>We knew that these ammonoids lived around this period during anisian and ladinian, Different color bars indicate different ammonites type.
                              The ammonite species sequence in basinal succession corresponds nicely to that found in the Latemar. Based on the coeval fossils, 
                              the maximal equivalent of the 470 m Latemar cyclic succession in the basinal succession was found to be around 6-10 m. 
                              It would be crazy to say that this 10 m of equivalent basinal deposit took 9-12 Ma to form (as suggested by Goldhammer, Hinnov..
                              Therefore the corresponding successions in latemar cannot take 9-12 ma to form

                               Besides the biostratigraphic features, There‘s some other interesting features we can see in this graph: 
                               Tuff layers (green). This can be used for a more precise radiometric dating, which is the second dating method. </p>
                           
                           <p>Here you can see these greenish ash layers in real (show). 
                              This is a 75 m thick succession of pelagic sediments that are interrupted by multiple layers of acidic volcanoclastic material (Pietra Verde)
                              Luckily, the slope deposits seen in the background are interfingering with the Buchenstein formation. 
                              So there is a lateral connection between these the platform deposits (such as Latemar) and the Buchenstein beds.
                              Also, both lie directly above the contrin formation (in yellow), which basically represents a common lower boundary of these two sequences.
                              (Slide back) This is also nicely visible in the stratigraphic columns here
                              Now, how is the presence of volcanoclastic layers helping us to understand the age thresholds of the Latemar section? 
                              As you probably all know, volcanic ashfalls contain zircons, which can be used isotope dating and deliver usmore precise, 
                              absolute ages compared to the biostratigraphic approach.</p>
                            <p> Method:
                                - High-resolution, single-grain U-Pb age determinations have been performed on zircons from several individual volcaniclastic 
                                intercalations at Seceda and closely correlated sections at Bagolino and (later) Monte San Giorgio. 
                                - Newly-formed zircon deposits will contain no lead, meaning that any lead found in the mineral is radiogenic. 
                                Important:
                                - Which layers were picked (show a Pietra Verde layer above upper age threshold indicated by Seceda fossils coeval to Latemar fauna L4)
                                Results:
                                Ages of crystallization of the zircon grains are taken as an approximation for the time of deposition of the volcaniclastic layers. 
                                An age of 241.2 +0.8/-0.6 Ma (95% confidence level) has been obtained from zircon grains in the lower part of the Buchenstein Beds. 
                                These tuff beds correspond to the lowermost part of the cyclic succession at Latemar. 
                                An age of 238.0+0.4/-0.7 Ma obtained from zircons in a layer in the uppermost Buchenstein Beds corresponds to a level younger than 
                                the top of the cyclic succession at Latemar. </p>
                            
                            <p>A third method is the Magnetostratigraphy. A Collection of 73  samples were take from the base to the top of latemor successions. 
                                The initial samples of Virtual Geomagnetic Pole latitude versus stratigraphic sample level are indicated by the white dots. 
                                With the contamination on magnetization from lightnings calibrated, VGP latitude vs altitude is now shown by the black dots.
                                As a result we can see that there is No polarity change, or maybe one, could be observed within the cyclic succession of Latemar. 
                                Normally, Middle Triassic includes 25 polarity intervals(which means around 0.5ma interval between magnetic polarity change), 
                                which suggests that we cannot be anywhere close to 9-12 Ma of deposition time, but that this 470 m of Latemar was formed in less than 1 ma.</p>
                            <p>We can see with dating method developing over time, we have shorter and shorter time constraint on Latemar formation period. 
                                Earlier it was dated on Bagolino, later the dating was taken directly on Latemar. 
                                And a latest paper in 2018 agreed the ~1ma formation time. In addition it mentioned a thin layer of less than 1 meter in that region showed precession feature.
                                But the counter group insists on that this whole succession was formed with Milankovitch character.</p>
                            <p>- If 598 cycles assumed (Goldhammers value), maximum cycle duration would be 8 ka (but likely lower because top surface of Latemar can be assumed to be erosional, leading to even shorter cycles)
                                - Options to explain the cycle duration (assuming cycle count by Goldhammer is correct:  
                                (1) cycles have identical periods and represent sealevel oscillations of > 8 ka duration (Sub-Milankovitch cycles)
                                (2) Latemar stack is composed of intervals with Milankovitch characteristics AND other signals (signals Non-periodic or of much shorter duration (local occurrence of 5:1 bundles))
                                (3) None of Latemar “cycles” are periodic (not even allocyclic theory approvable).
                                Based on thickness hierarchies, that are exposure-capped cycles, cannot be generated by single-periodicity sea-level signal and, furthermore, they argue that Hinnov (1994) recently found that the Latemar’s Upper Cyclic Facies exhibits all major frequency components of climatic precession.
                                Are the sampled volcanoclastic rocks primary ashfalls?
                                With respect to other studies that reported “reworked” acid volcanic material in the Buchenstein beds in the Dolomites, Hardie & Hinnovargue argue that Brack et al. might have used reworked and resedimented late Anisian-earliest Ladinian volcanic debris. (= isotope ages appears younger than they actually are due to reworking)
                                Methodologic critique:
                                Use of transmitted light instead of cathodo-luminescence CL and back-scattered electrons (BSE)
                                - But Kent and Brack argued back that, the most convining method, which is U-Pb zircon dating, was ignored on purpose. This is because the data did not match their allocyclic conclusion. In view of the latest development, this 
                                - </p>
                            <p>ALLOCYCLIC:
                                Regarding the question of allocyclicity and autocyclicity, it is important to emphasize that the regular, 
                                cyclic bedding patterns are found at locations that are over 200 km apart from each other.
                                Also, the patterns occur in Buchenstein beds at different facies and basins, such as the Seceda and Andraz (Dolomites), as well as Bagolino and S. Valentino in the Lombardy
                                This distribution pattern speaks for an external forcing of the deposition cycles, hence, an allocyclic forcing. 
                                Even Brack et al. concluded the existence of precession forced parts in the Buchenstein Formation (show: here at Seceda, 20cm thick layers, 5:1 bundling)
                                However, at Latemar, Brack et al. proved the bedding frequencies to be much higher, suggesting autocyclic forcing, at least for this part
In this sense, the 470 m thick cyclic beds at Latemar are coeval and fit into a very narrow Buchenstein sequence of only 10 m thickness
This (click) very visual comparison shows this difference very clearly. (show) the 600 cyclic beds at Latemar fit into here... (thanks to Mr. Brack for the visualization)
If we assume autocyclic forcing and periodic cycles at Latemar, the cycle duration would correspond to 1 ka
Given the fast amount of 470 m of sediment thickness, a very constant sedimentation rate of about 1000 m / Ma
This again, forces the question of a possible influence tectonic component. This is, because normally sea level doesn’t decrease at this rate just by itself
So: not (only) sealevel fluctuations controlling the patterns
Other localities with much thinner sequences, suggesting local differences in subsidence
Other possible explanations: tidal forcing (since wespeak about exposure capped cycles, tepee structures)
Climatic variations (according to Kent et al climatic variations with cycles of about 1.5 ka could be observed for the late Pleistocene and Holocene >> solar fluctuations)
What do you think about the two theories, what makes sense for you
