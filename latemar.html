                            <p> Latemar is a carbonate platform in North Italy. 
                                It was around Westernmost area of Triassic Tethys, during Middle Triassic under marine environment.
                                
                                                        
                              The Latemar controversy is over the mechanism in which Latemar was formed.
                              Intense debates exist among researchers on whether the strong cyclic character of Latemar was mainly autocyclic, 
                              meaning driven by external forcing, or allocyclic, meaning it’s driven by more local forcings.
                              Whilst Goldhammer and Hinnov proposed that the 600-700 cycles of Latemar were formed through 9-12 mya, 
                              Brack and Kent argued that the formation time was much shorter. </p>
                            
                            <p> Milankovitch periodicity was brought up because it was popular in the 90s. Middle Triassic is about 10 mya, 
                                therefore it is doubted that the formation of Latemar could take more than the whole middle Triassic. </p>
                            
                            <p>Latemar is here. Notice also secede and bagolino here because they are also important 
                               locations later in dating the Latemar succesion. Latemar has a radius of around 3km. 
                               We focuse on the top 470 meter of the Latemar platform succession, which contains around 600 cycles
                               (Group of 5 thinning-upward megacycles).</p>
                            
                            <p> If we take Latemar setting to a sketch, we can see in the middle are Latemar and other carbonate platforms
                                (From bottom to top we have Contrin formation, lower platform facies, lower cyclic facies, 
                                tepee facies, upper cyclic facies On the sides are slopes) So a more simplified sketch would look like this
                                Red line: continuously growing beds of carbonate platform (600-800 m thick platform interior succession)
                                Orange line: slope, dipping beds of rubble
                                In the middle is the carbonate platform, formed under the influence of sea surface fluctuations
                                basinal deposits is about 60-70m </p>
                            
                            <p> Now we zoom out a bit, on around 200-300km scale, 
                               If we cut it vertically and present the section along this red line, 
                               we have a series of carbonate platform and basinal beds. 
                               The blueish part representing the pelagic basinal part (Buchenstein Beds (semi-)pelagic sediments) 
                               and the greenish representing carbonate platform, seceda and bagolino are here. 
                               One of the methods to date Latemar succession is that, 
                               if we can connect the layers in Latemar to somewhere else where we can be sure about the age, 
                               we can use that as the age of latemar formation. For example, if we can find some layers in Latemar corresponding some layers in buchenstein beds, 
                               then the period for latemar formation would be just the same as the time taken to form the corresponding buchenstein beds
                               This brings us to the first method, biostratigraphy.</p>
                            
                            <p> With biostratigraphy, fossils of ammonites and Daonella were sampled. This is a pic of ammonites.
                                Dark ammonites: were found in basinal Buchenstein Beds, they were formed in pelagic environment. 
                                Brighter ammonites: found in Latemar, deposited in platform interior. 
                                But they are of the same type. so if same type of ammonites fossils can be found in both basinal bed and the Latemar, 
                                they are coeval Faunas L1–L4 are ammonoids and Daonella. 
                                At the beginning ammonites were only found in very low altitude in Latemer (show L1 in graph), 
                                so only lower age boundary was certain. For the upper age threshold they first used L3 and L4, 
                                found on the slopes near latemar, which were interpreted to be coeval to upper cyclic Latemar succession
                                Later (2003): ammonites were found also on top of Latemar (L5, see image to the left), 
                                which finally enabled defining the upper age boundary. 
                                These fossils were connected the same type of ammonites found in the Buchenstein beds of Bagolino and Seceda (next slide)</p>
                           <p>We knew that these ammonoids lived around this period during anisian and ladinian, Different color bars indicate different ammonites type.
                              The ammonite species sequence in basinal succession corresponds nicely to that found in the Latemar. Based on the coeval fossils, 
                              the maximal equivalent of the 470 m Latemar cyclic succession in the basinal succession was found to be around 6-10 m. 
                              It would be crazy to say that this 10 m of equivalent basinal deposit took 9-12 Ma to form (as suggested by Goldhammer, Hinnov..
                              Therefore the corresponding successions in latemar cannot take 9-12 ma to form

                               Besides the biostratigraphic features, There‘s some other interesting features we can see in this graph: 
                               Tuff layers (green). This can be used for a more precise radiometric dating, which is the second dating method. </p>
                           
                           <p>Here you can see these greenish ash layers in real (show). 
                              This is a 75 m thick succession of pelagic sediments that are interrupted by multiple layers of acidic volcanoclastic material (Pietra Verde)
                              Luckily, the slope deposits seen in the background are interfingering with the Buchenstein formation. 
                              So there is a lateral connection between these the platform deposits (such as Latemar) and the Buchenstein beds.
                              Also, both lie directly above the contrin formation (in yellow), which basically represents a common lower boundary of these two sequences.
                              (Slide back) This is also nicely visible in the stratigraphic columns here
                              Now, how is the presence of volcanoclastic layers helping us to understand the age thresholds of the Latemar section? 
                              As you probably all know, volcanic ashfalls contain zircons, which can be used isotope dating and deliver usmore precise, 
                              absolute ages compared to the biostratigraphic approach.</p>
                            <p> Method:
                                - High-resolution, single-grain U-Pb age determinations have been performed on zircons from several individual volcaniclastic 
                                intercalations at Seceda and closely correlated sections at Bagolino and (later) Monte San Giorgio. 
                                - Newly-formed zircon deposits will contain no lead, meaning that any lead found in the mineral is radiogenic. 
                                Important:
                                - Which layers were picked (show a Pietra Verde layer above upper age threshold indicated by Seceda fossils coeval to Latemar fauna L4)
                                Results:
                                Ages of crystallization of the zircon grains are taken as an approximation for the time of deposition of the volcaniclastic layers. 
                                An age of 241.2 +0.8/-0.6 Ma (95% confidence level) has been obtained from zircon grains in the lower part of the Buchenstein Beds. 
                                These tuff beds correspond to the lowermost part of the cyclic succession at Latemar. 
                                An age of 238.0+0.4/-0.7 Ma obtained from zircons in a layer in the uppermost Buchenstein Beds corresponds to a level younger than 
                                the top of the cyclic succession at Latemar. </p>
                            
                            <p>A third method is the Magnetostratigraphy. A Collection of 73  samples were take from the base to the top of latemor successions. 
                                The initial samples of Virtual Geomagnetic Pole latitude versus stratigraphic sample level are indicated by the white dots. 
                                With the contamination on magnetization from lightnings calibrated, VGP latitude vs altitude is now shown by the black dots.
                                As a result we can see that there is No polarity change, or maybe one, could be observed within the cyclic succession of Latemar. 
                                Normally, Middle Triassic includes 25 polarity intervals(which means around 0.5ma interval between magnetic polarity change), 
                                which suggests that we cannot be anywhere close to 9-12 Ma of deposition time, but that this 470 m of Latemar was formed in less than 1 ma.</p>
