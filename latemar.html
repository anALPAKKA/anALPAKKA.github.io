                            <p> Latemar is a carbonate platform in North Italy. 
                                It was around Westernmost area of Triassic Tethys, during Middle Triassic under marine environment.
                                
                                                        
                              The Latemar controversy is over the mechanism in which Latemar was formed.
                              Intense debates exist among researchers on whether the strong cyclic character of Latemar was mainly autocyclic, 
                              meaning driven by external forcing, or allocyclic, meaning itâ€™s driven by more local forcings.
                              Whilst Goldhammer and Hinnov proposed that the 600-700 cycles of Latemar were formed through 9-12 mya, 
                              Brack and Kent argued that the formation time was much shorter. </p>
                            
                            <p> Milankovitch periodicity was brought up because it was popular in the 90s. Middle Triassic is about 10 mya, 
                                therefore it is doubted that the formation of Latemar could take more than the whole middle Triassic. </p>
                            
                            <p>Latemar is here. Notice also secede and bagolino here because they are also important 
                               locations later in dating the Latemar succesion. Latemar has a radius of around 3km. 
                               We focuse on the top 470 meter of the Latemar platform succession, which contains around 600 cycles
                               (Group of 5 thinning-upward megacycles).</p>
                            
                            <p> If we take Latemar setting to a sketch, we can see in the middle are Latemar and other carbonate platforms
                                (From bottom to top we have Contrin formation, lower platform facies, lower cyclic facies, 
                                tepee facies, upper cyclic facies On the sides are slopes) So a more simplified sketch would look like this
                                Red line: continuously growing beds of carbonate platform (600-800 m thick platform interior succession)
                                Orange line: slope, dipping beds of rubble
                                In the middle is the carbonate platform, formed under the influence of sea surface fluctuations
                                basinal deposits is about 60-70m </p>
