                            <p> Latemar is a carbonate platform with a radius of around 3 km located in North Italy.
                               It was formed during Middle Triassic around westernmost area of Triassic Tethys under marine environment. 
			       The focus of this essay is on the top 470 m of the Latemar platform succession, which contains around 600 cycles,

                            <p> The Latemar controversy is over the mechanism of Latemar formation.
                              Intense debates exist among researchers on whether the strong cyclic character of Latemar was mainly autocyclic, 
                              meaning driven by external forcing, or allocyclic, driven by more local forcings.
                              Whilst Goldhammer and Hinnov[1] proposed that the 600-700 cycles of Latemar were formed through 9-12 million years (Myr) ago, 
                              Brack and Kent[2] argued that the formation time was much shorter. As the Middle Triassic is about 10 Myr, 
                              it is doubted that the formation of Latemar could take more than the whole middle Triassic.</p>

			       <p> One of the methods to date Latemar succession is to connect the layers in Latemar to somewhere else where the age is better dated 
                               and use that as the age of latemar formation. For example, if we can find some layers in Latemar corresponding to certain layers in the 
			       buchenstein beds, then the period for latemar formation is just the same as the time taken to form the corresponding buchenstein beds
                               This leads us to the first dating method, biostratigraphy.</p>

                               The carbonate platform (600-800 m thick platform interior succession) in the middle was formed under the influence of sea surface fluctuations and the

                            <p> With biostratigraphic approach, fossils of ammonites and Daonella were sampled.
                                Dark ammonites were found in basinal Buchenstein Beds and they were formed in pelagic environment. 
                                Brighter ammonites were found in Latemar, deposited in platform interior. 
                                These ammonites found in both basinal bed and the Latemar are of the same type and are coeval. 
				Faunas L1–L4 are Ammonoids and Daonella. 
                                At the beginning, ammonites were only found in very low altitude in Latemer (L1), 
                                therefore only the lower age boundary was certain. 
				L3 and L4 were first used for the upper age threshold, 
                                found on the slopes near latemar, which were interpreted to be coeval to upper cyclic Latemar succession
                                Later in 2003, ammonites (L5) were also found on top of Latemar, 
                                which finally enabled defining the upper age boundary. 
                                These fossils were connected to the same type of ammonites found in the Buchenstein beds of Bagolino and Seceda.</p>

                           <p>These Ammonoids lived around the periods of Anisian and Ladinian. 
                              The Ammonite species sequence in basinal succession corresponds nicely to that found in the Latemar. Based on the coeval fossils, 
                              the maximal equivalent of the 470 m Latemar cyclic succession in the basinal succession was found to be around 6-10 m. 
			      Since the formation time of this 6-10 m succession is equivalent to that of the 470 m succession at Latemar, 
                              The 9-12 Myr formation time suggested by Goldhammer and Hinnov [1] therefore seems rather unreasonable.</p>

                              This 75 m thick succession of pelagic sediments is interrupted by multiple layers of acidic volcanoclastic material - "Pietra Verde" bed.
                              The slope deposits in the background are interfingering with the Buchenstein formation. 
                              A lateral connection exists between these platform deposits (such as Latemar) and the Buchenstein beds.
                             In addition, as both the Latemar and the Buchenstein beds lie directly above the contrin formation, a common lower boundary of these two sequences can be identified.
                           </p>
                             The presence of volcanoclastic layers can help in finding the age thresholds of the Latemar section as 
                              volcanic ashfalls contain zircons, which can be used for isotope dating and deliver more precise, 
                              absolute ages comparing to the biostratigraphic approach. This daing method is based on the decay of Uranium (U) to lead (Pb) 
			      and the time-dependent enrichment of Pb within zircon. Newly-formed zircon deposits will contain no lead, meaning that any lead found in the mineral is radiogenic. 
                                High-resolution, single-grain U-Pb age determinations has been performed on zircons from several individual volcaniclastic 
                                intercalations at Seceda, which was found to be closely correlated with sections at Bagolino and Monte San Giorgio.   </p>

				<p>Results:
                                Ages of crystallization of the zircon grains are taken as an approximation for the time of deposition of the volcaniclastic layers. 
                                An age of 241.2 +0.8/-0.6 Ma (95% confidence level) has been obtained from zircon grains in the lower part of the Buchenstein Beds. 
                                These tuff beds correspond to the lowermost part of the cyclic succession at Latemar. 
                                An age of 238.0+0.4/-0.7 Ma obtained from zircons in a layer in the uppermost Buchenstein Beds corresponds to a level younger than 
                                the top of the cyclic succession at Latemar. </p>

                            <p>A third dating method is the magnetostratigraphy. A collection of 73 samples were taken from the base to the top of latemor successions. 
                                The initial samples of virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) latitude versus stratigraphic sample level are indicated by the white dots. 
                                With the contamination on magnetization from lightnings removed, the black dots show the calibrated VGP latitude versus altitude.
		                As a result, we can see that there is no polarity change, or at most one potential polarity change, observed within the cyclic succession of Latemar. 
                                Normally, Middle Triassic includes 25 polarity intervals (which means around 0.5 Myr interval between magnetic polarity change), 
                                This suggests that we cannot be anywhere close to 9-12 Ma of deposition time, but that this 470 m of Latemar was formed in less than 1 Myr.</p>

			    <p>With dating methods developing over time, a better time constraint on Latemar formation period is being achieved. 
                                While earlier dating was taken on Bagolino, later on the dating was taken directly on Latemar. 
                                And a latest paper in 2018 agreed the ~1ma formation time. In addition it mentioned a thin layer of less than 1 meter in that region showed precession feature.
                                But the counter group insists on that this whole succession was formed with Milankovitch character.</p>
			    <!--Milankovitch periodicity was brought up because it was popular in the 90s.-->
			    
			    
                            <p> With 598 cycles suggested by Goldhammer, the maximum cycle duration is 8 thousand years (kyr). 
				    However, the actual cycle duration is likely to be even shorter because top surface of Latemar has been eroded.
			There are three explainations to the cycle duration at Latemar suggested by Brack et al. in 1996 [1]: 
                                (1) Cycles have identical periods and represent sea level oscillations with longer than 8 kyr duration (sub-Milankovitch cycles);
                                (2) Latemar stack is composed of intervals with Milankovitch characteristics as well as other non-periodic signals or signals of much shorter duration. 
			    The local occurrence of 5:1 bundles could be a proof; 
                                (3) None of these Latemar “cycles” are periodic, neither allocyclic or autocyclic.</p>
			    
			    <p>Hardie and Hinnov made comments on these hypotheses in 1997 [2].
                                Based on thickness hierarchies, which are exposure-capped cycles, the cycles cannot be generated by single-periodicity sea-level signal.
			    Furthermore, they argue that Hinnov (1994) found that the Latemar’s upper cyclic facies exhibit all major frequency components of climatic precession.
                              
			    They also questioned if the sampled volcanoclastic rocks are primarily ashfalls.
                               With respect to other studies that reported “reworked” acid volcanic material in the Buchenstein beds in the Dolomites, 
				Hardie and Hinnov [2] argued that Brack et al. [1] might have used reworked and resedimented late Anisian-earliest Ladinian volcanic debris. 
				 Hence they doubt the isotope ages appears younger than they actually are due to reworking.
                                Methodologic critique:

                                - But Kent and Brack argued back that, the most convining method, which is U-Pb zircon dating, was ignored on purpose. This is because the data did not match their allocyclic conclusion. In view of the latest development, this

                            <p>ALLOCYCLIC:
                                Regarding the question of allocyclicity and autocyclicity, it is important to emphasize that the regular, 
                                cyclic bedding patterns are found at locations that are over 200 km apart from each other.
                                Also, the patterns occur in Buchenstein beds at different facies and basins, such as the Seceda and Andraz (Dolomites), as well as Bagolino and S. Valentino in the Lombardy
                                This distribution pattern speaks for an external forcing of the deposition cycles, hence, an allocyclic forcing. 
                                Even Brack et al. concluded the existence of precession forced parts in the Buchenstein Formation (show: here at Seceda, 20cm thick layers, 5:1 bundling)
                                However, at Latemar, Brack et al. proved the bedding frequencies to be much higher, suggesting autocyclic forcing, at least for this part
In this sense, the 470 m thick cyclic beds at Latemar are coeval and fit into a very narrow Buchenstein sequence of only 10 m thickness
This (click) very visual comparison shows this difference very clearly. (show) the 600 cyclic beds at Latemar fit into here... (thanks to Mr. Brack for the visualization)
If we assume autocyclic forcing and periodic cycles at Latemar, the cycle duration would correspond to 1 ka
Given the fast amount of 470 m of sediment thickness, a very constant sedimentation rate of about 1000 m / Ma
This again, forces the question of a possible influence tectonic component. This is, because normally sea level doesn’t decrease at this rate just by itself
So: not (only) sealevel fluctuations controlling the patterns
Other localities with much thinner sequences, suggesting local differences in subsidence
Other possible explanations: tidal forcing (since wespeak about exposure capped cycles, tepee structures)
Climatic variations (according to Kent et al climatic variations with cycles of about 1.5 ka could be observed for the late Pleistocene and Holocene >> solar fluctuations)
What do you think about the two theories, what makes sense for you
