							<p>Summer 2019, after I finished my bachelor study in London, I decided to take a gap-year before Master study to explore around a bit on what field I would like to continue working in. 
							I joined Dr. Yu for his project idea of developing a micro-chip based weather forecast display device - it would look a bit like an alarm clock on your nightstand, 
							or a humidity measure on your wall, only that it displays weather now and coming in a few hours. 
							The idea was questioned by pretty much everyone: why does anyone need an additional device to see the weather if they can pull out their smartphone and see every information on their Apps?
							</p>


							<p>
								By the end of my employment, we got a fully functioning prototype and applied for patent. 
								However, the commercialisation was way more difficult - a more attractive design of interface, real-life user test, an attractive marketing strategy - all beyond our expertise as researchers.
								Deep inside, I believe such a device can bring huge benefits to people. But I didn't have convincing enough proof to demonstrate.
							</p>

							<p>
								I carried this question with me to Bern, where I stayed for my Master study. One of the most popular local activities is probably swimming in the Aare river in summer 
								- some even commute by floating down the river. At Parkplatz Marzili, one of the popular entry to Aare, a real-time screen displays the current and forecasted condition of the river, 
								showing the temperature, water volume and all necessary information one needs to know for safely swimming in a rapid river like Aare. 
								People always check on various weather Apps on their own smartphones before coming to Marzili, but always get a final confirmation glance at the display before jumping into the river.
							</p>

    			    	<h2 class="smaller-header">Extreme Weather Events</h2>                                
                            </header>

							<p>
								In city life, people start to disaccociate from natural weather. Radiator and air-conditioning provides fine adjustment to indoor temperature. 
								Plus, regardless of the precipitation prediction tomorrow, I would always put an umbrella in my bag when I was living in London, or now in Hamburg. 
							</p>	

							<p>
								In 2021 summer, Henan province, where 10% of the chinese population reside, 200mm rainfall was recorded within 1 hour, the highest record ever since there was a weather record there. 
								The street was full of people who were not fully aware of how catastrophic this was getting. They were trying to get back home as soon as possible, intuitively as most human beings would when facing natural disasters.
								However, some never made their way back. In the end, a total of 398 deaths were counted, out of which 14 drowned in the metro, and 6 found in a jammed tunnel.
