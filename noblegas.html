				 		<p> A few meters beneath the Antarctic surface, snow from past winters is still recognizable as snow. 
							Go deeper, and that same snow becomes something stranger: a slowly compacting archive that traps tiny samples of the ancient atmosphere. 
							Those trapped air bubbles—sealed away for tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years—are one of the most direct ways we can 
							measure what the atmosphere was like long before instruments existed. 
						</p>
						<p> 
							This is why ice cores are often seen as “time capsules.” 
							They contain more than ice: they preserve aerosols, dust, volcanic signals, and gases such as CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O. 
							And because the layers build up year by year, many ice cores behave like a climate library arranged in chronological order (so-called continuous cores).
						</p> 

					
						<p> 
							The use of ice cores in paleoclimate studies was first proposed in the 1950s by Willi Dansgaard [1]. 
							Today, the longest widely used continuous Antarctic ice-core records reach back roughly 800,000 years. 
							Scientists are now pushing beyond that—toward 1.5 million years—to better understand how Earth’s glacial

							<!-- Antarctica ice cores are a powerful tool for retrieving past climate data: 
                                    		they are like time capsules containing dust and air bubbles trapped in there from millennia ago. 
                                    		The use of ice cores in paleoclimate studies was first proposed in the 1950s by Willi Dansgaard [1]. 
						In polar regions, snow keeps accumulating every year on the continental ice sheet, forming a permeable 
						layer called firn (Fig 1).The firn layer is about 50-100m deep(Schwander, 1996), and it may take up to 3 kyr (1 kyr = 1000 years) 
						before the airbubble enters the close-up depth [1].
						
							
						Most ice core samples have layers in chronological order, which are known as continuous cores. 
						Currently the oldest continuous ice core traces back to 800,000 years ago [2].
                                    		Scientists have been seeking increasingly older ice to extend our understanding of the planet’s climate history. 
						However, finding older ice is challenging due to the dynamic nature of Antarctica's ice, which flows toward the continent's edges and eventually melts 
						into the ocean. Scientists (DEEPICE project led by EU and COLDEX led by Oregon State University) are currently aiming to retrieve continuous ice cores 
						that extend up to 1.5 million years back.-->

				 		<p>Fig.1 Schematics of the fim column [2] In polar regions, snowfall accumulates and compresses under its own weight. The upper tens of meters are still porous, 
							like a stiff sponge. This porous zone is the firn layer, typically on the order of 50–100 m thick [3]. 
							Air can move through firn, meaning the ice at that depth is not yet “sealed off” from the atmosphere. Eventually, the pores 
							close and air becomes trapped as bubbles at the bubble close-off depth. It can take up to 3 kyr (1 kyr = 1000 years) for air to be fully isolated [1].</p>

                             <p><strong>The global mean ocean temperature (MOT)</strong> is an important measure for the state of Earth climate: 
								 as the ocean stores over 90% the excess heat in the climate system, MOT reflects the global energy balance status. 
								 Reconstructing MOT is hard, though. Many proxies have been proposed for the paleoclimatic reconstruction of the oceantemperature, 
								 for instance, the ratio of magnesium to calcium in benthic foraminiferal species (Bryan and Marchitto, 2008), heavy oxygen isotope 
								 content of fossils or carbonaterocks, and Sr to Ca ratio in the corals (Lea, 2014). But they tend to reflect local or regional 
								 conditions, and they can be influenced by biology or chemistry processes that are not fully understood yet (Ritz et al., 2011).

						 	That’s where noble gases become attractive: their behaviour is dominated by physics.

			</header>

				  
	<p>
    <strong>Noble gases</strong> (Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) are chemically inert under Earth-surface conditions.
    They don’t get consumed by ecosystems, and they aren’t produced or destroyed by the common chemical
    reactions that shape many other climate tracers. Over the timescales relevant for glacial cycles,
    their total amount in the Earth system is close to conserved:
    </p>

  <div class="equation" aria-label="Noble gas inventory conservation equation">
    <p><em>I</em><sub>tot</sub> = <em>I</em><sub>atm</sub> + <em>I</em><sub>ocn</sub></p>
  </div>

  <p>
    where <em>I</em><sub>atm</sub> and <em>I</em><sub>ocn</sub> are the atmospheric and oceanic inventories.
    This conservation makes noble gases unusually “clean” proxies: the signal is dominated by physics
    rather than biology or reactive chemistry.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    The key idea is solubility. Noble gases dissolve in seawater, and their <strong>solubility depends strongly on temperature</strong>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Warm ocean</strong> &rarr; lower solubility &rarr; more noble gas remains in the atmosphere
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cold ocean</strong> &rarr; higher solubility &rarr; more noble gas dissolves into the ocean
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If the ocean cools, it can “pull” a little more noble gas out of the atmosphere. If it warms, it
    “releases” some back. These shifts are small, but measurable—especially using ratios such as
    <strong>Kr/N<sub>2</sub></strong>, <strong>Xe/N<sub>2</sub></strong>, or <strong>Ar/N<sub>2</sub></strong>
    in air bubbles trapped in ice cores. Because N<sub>2</sub> is abundant and comparatively stable,
    ratios help reduce certain calibration and measurement artifacts.
  </p>

					The potential of using noble gases as MOT proxies was seen due to their unique properties: 
                      they are chemically inert and their solubility is temperature-dependent. 
                     The solubility of noble gases in seawater decreases with increasing ocean temperature, 
                     and thus a lower MOT should result in a lower atmospheric inventory. 
                                    This change can be measured in the noble gas mixing ratios from air bubbles trapped in ice cores.

					   
					Noble gases refer to elements of group 18 in the periodic table. With the outermost electronic shells being 
				    completely filled, noble gases exhibit chemical inertness (Pan et al.,2013). Apart from Helium, which can escape 
				    from the Earth’s gravity, and Radon, whichis radioactive, the other four noble gases - Neon, 
				    Argon, Krypton and Xenon have no essential sinks or sources and therefore have conserved total inventories in 
				    the Earthsystem (Bereiter et al., 2018b). This constraint of the mass conservation of any specific noble gas can 
				    be expressed asItot = Iatm + Iocn, (1)where Iatm and Iocn are their oceanic and atmospheric inventories. 
				    This equation also holds for nitrogen, as the change of N2 inventories (nitrification and denitrification) in nature 
				    is negligible for the total inventories (Gruber, 2004; Schlesinger, 1997). 
				    Given the inert nature of noble gases, Headly and Severinghaus (2007) first suggested the potential of using δKr/N2 
				    measured from air bubbles trapped in the ice cores as theproxy to reconstruct the MOT during the 
				    Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Owing to the similarities in their chemical properties, δAr/N2 and δXe/N2 have also been 
				    used as MOT proxies in later research.

                                <p>Simulation results show that two factors, the sea ice and the state of the At- lantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), 
                                    have influence on noble gases responses to MOT change via air-sea gas exchange. 
                                    </p>
                                
                               
				<p>While proxy studies suggest that a collapsed AMOC existed in the past, the Bern3D 2.0 model was not able to reproduce it in LGM conditions, 
                                    neither has there been strong disagreement between the current noble gas reconstructed MOT records and other temperature proxy reconstructions. 
                                    Overall, noble gases can be used as reliable proxies for the past 800 kyr MOT reconstructions, 
                                    although sea ice may cause small deficit by partially blocking the air-sea gas exchange and generating undersaturation. 
                                    Rare situations are discussed when proxy reliability is compromised by shutdown of AMOC.</p>
